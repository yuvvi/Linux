1. 
  can list /lib and /usr/lib explicitly in /etc/ld.so.conf
  or one of the files in /etc/ld.so.conf.d,
  that way directories coming after those two will have lower priority in the search.

  Something like this:

  # contents of /etc/ld.so.conf
  /lib
  /usr/lib
  /ParanoidAndroid
  Don't forget to:

  $ sudo ldconfig
  And you can check that with:

  $ ldconfig -v
  
    Default paths: /lib (used for libraries of system packages),
    and then /usr/lib (possible location for the libraries of non-system packages).
    
2. LDCONFIG INPUT
  
  ldconfig needs to know what directories to survey. By default it surveys “trusted directories” /lib and /usr/lib.
  In addition, ldconfig consults configuration file /etc/ld.so.conf, a text file which provides a list of directories to survey.
  
  According to one convention, ld.so.conf contains an instruction: “include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf“,
  establishing a directory in which new packages can place their own xyz.conf file to make their own lib directories available.
